# Accessing Vocareum

You will access Vocareum **through Canvas** by clicking on the "Load in a new
window" button at the bottom of a graded item that uses Vocareum. The first
time that you access Vocareum (in Module 0), you will need to enter the
**access code** provided to you by the AU All Access program via an email from
`noreply@auburn.edu`. This email is sent the day before classes, and could be
automatically  moved in to your Junk folder. You will only need the access code
the first time you use Vocareum.
