# Welcome to COMP 2210 Fall 2023!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's also one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this semester!  

The first lecture will be on *Thursday, August 17* from 8:00 AM CT - 9:15 AM CT
in Shelby 1103 for the Campus sections (001 - 004) and in Zoom (`TBD`) for
the Distance section (D01). Labs will begin on Tuesday, August 22 from 9:30 AM
CT - 10:45 AM CT in the computer labs shown in Tiger Scheduler for the Campus
sections and in Zoom (`TBD`) for the Distance section.

See you on August 17, and War Eagle!
