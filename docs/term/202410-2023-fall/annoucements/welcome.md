# Welcome to COMP 2210 Fall 2023!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's also one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this semester!  

The first lecture will be on *Thursday, August 17* from 8:00 AM CT - 9:15 AM CT
in Shelby 1103 for the Campus sections (001 - 004) and in Zoom (`893 7371 4219`)
for the Distance section (D01). Labs will not meet the first week of classes but
will begin on August 22.

See you on August 17, and War Eagle!
