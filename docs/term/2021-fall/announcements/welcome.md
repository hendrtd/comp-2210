Welcome to COMP 2210 Fall 2021!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this semester. Thanks for your
patience as we've rolled out the course in unexpectedly hectic and unusual
circumstances this fall, but it's now up and live and we're ready to go!

The first lecture will be on Thursday, August 19 from 8:00 AM CT - 9:15 AM CT in
Shelby 1103 for the Campus sections (001-008) and in Zoom ID 882 2190 5300 for
the Distance section (D01). Labs will not meet the first week but will instead
begin on Tuesday, August 24. Please refer to the course syllabus for details on
instructional modality, course policies, grading and more.

See you on Thursday, and War Eagle!
