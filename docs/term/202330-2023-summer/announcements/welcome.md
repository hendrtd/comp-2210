# Welcome to COMP 2210 Spring 2023!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's also one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this semester!  

I am out of town on University business Wednesday January 11 through Friday
January 13, so COMP 2210 will not meet in lecture or lab the first week of the
semester. 

The first lecture will be on *Tuesday, January 17* from 8:00 AM CT - 9:15 AM CT
in Shelby 1103 for the Campus section (001) and in Zoom (`842 5324 0912`) for
the Distance section (D01). Labs will begin on Thursday, January 19 from 9:30 AM
CT - 10:45 AM CT. Details regarding the location of lab meetings will be
announced in Canvas prior to the first lab meeting.

The Canvas course for COMP 2210 will be published and available no later than
Monday, January 16.

See you on January 17, and War Eagle!
