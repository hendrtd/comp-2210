# Welcome to COMP 2210 Spring 2024!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's also one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this semester!  

The first lecture will be on *Thursday, January 11* from 8:00 AM CT - 9:15 AM CT
in Foy 258 for all sections. Labs do not meet the first week, so the first lab
meeting will be on *Tuesday, January 16* at the time and in the lab room
assigned to the section for which you registered.

This is a combined lecture/lab course that meets for 150 minutes each week in
lecture and for 150 minutes each week in lab. There are 10 course sections that
all meet together for lecture but separately for lab. Be sure to check Tiger
Scheduler to confirm the course section for which you are registered, since
Canvas can make it appear (incorrectly) that everyone is in the same section of
the course.

The course will be opened in Canvas before the 8:00 AM lecture on January 11,
and I look forward to seeing you then.

War Eagle!
