# ACM Student Org - Get Engaged, Get Involved!

The Association for Computing Machinery[ACM](https://www.acm.org/) is the
world's largest professional society in computing, providing community, dialog,
jand resources for students, educators, researchers, and professionals. Auburn's
student chapter of the ACM is very active and provides a range of opportunities
to get involved, learn new things, and meet other people on campus who are
interested in computer science and software engineering. 

## Kick-Off Meeting

The ACM chapter hosts a Kick-Off meeting at the beginning of each fall and spring semester. Here are the details from the ACM officers for this semester.

> Hello students! Auburn Association for Computing Machinery will be holding its Spring Semester Kickoff this Thursday, January 18th, at 5:00 PM in Shelby Center, Room 1103. ACM hosts a few smaller clubs, like Ethical Hacking Club, Competitive Programming Team, Web Development Club, Technical Interview Association, and Auburn Hacks, and we will be hearing from the leaders of each of them. Getting involved with ACM and these clubs is a great way to apply some of the things you learn in class, and it can make the whole Auburn CSSE experience come together. In addition, we will have free pizza! If you plan on attending, please RSVP at aub.ie/acmspringkickoff. We hope to see all of you there!

## Why get involved?

Joining a student org like ACM offer you benefits like:

- **Networking Opportunities:** ACM gives you the chance to network with other
students, faculty, and professionals in computer science and software
engineering. Networking can lead to valuable connections for academics,
internships, undergraduate research, and career opportunities.

- **Skill Development:** ACM offers tech-talks, workshops, and events that
provide opportunities to learn new things and develop new skills, often things
that you wouldn't have the chance to learn in a course.

valuable both personally and professionally.

community and belonging by connecting you with people who share common
interests and goals.

- **Personal Growth:** Getting involved with ACM encourages you to step out of
comfort zone, take on new responsibilities, and do new things. This is a great
way to increase self-confidence and self-awareness.
