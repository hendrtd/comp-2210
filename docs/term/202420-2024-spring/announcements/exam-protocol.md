# Exam Protocol

Here is the protocol you must follow during the lab exam. **Violation of any
requirement specified in this protocol can be considered Academic Dishonesty.**

- You must be physically present in your assigned lab room during your assigned
lab time to take the exam, and all work on the exam must be done from within
the lab during your scheduled lab time. You cannot take the exam in whole or
part outside of your assigned lab time and lab room.

- You must check in with your TA upon arrival.

- Backpacks must be put at the front of the room during the exam. You can’t
keep your backpack at your seat during the exam.

- Phones, tablets, smart watches, and other similar devices must be put away
during the exam. You can’t have these devices out during the exam.

- You are allowed to take a few sheets of the provided scratch paper. You will
have to turn in the scratch paper before you leave the exam.

- You are allowed to take the exam using either a lab computer or your own laptop. 

- If you use a lab computer, be sure to log in immediately once you've taken
your seat. Note that if this is the first time you've logged into a lab
machine, start-up time will be substantial. Extra time on the exam will not be
awarded for this situation.

- The exam is closed-book, closed-notes, closed-Google, etc. No resources may
be consulted or used during the exam.

- If you need to use the restroom during the exam, just let your TA know where
you’re going. Do not close your browser, do not exit the exam, do not take your
phone, laptop, or any other electronic device.

- When you have submitted the exam, you must sign out with the TA before you
can leave the lab.
