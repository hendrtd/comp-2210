# Exam Protocol

Here is the protocol you must follow during the exam.

- Backpacks must be put at the front of the room during the exam. You can’t
keep your backpack at your seat during the exam.

- Phones, tablets, smart watches, and other similar devices must be put away
during the exam. You can’t have these devices out during the exam.

- You can take the exam using either the lab machine or your own laptop.

- You can take a few sheets of the provided scratch paper if you like. You will
have to turn in the scratch paper before you leave the exam.

- The exam is closed-book, closed-notes, closed-Google, etc. No outside
resources are allowed during the exam.

- All work on the exam must be done from within the lab during your scheduled
lab time. Violations of this rule will be treated as academic dishonesty.

- When you have submitted the exam, you must sign out with the TA before you
can leave the lab.

- If you need to use the restroom during the exam, just let your TA know where
you’re going. Do not close your browser; leave it open until you return.

- If you are using a lab machine, be sure to log in immediately once you've
taken your seat. Note that if this is the first time you've logged into a lab
machine, start-up time will be substantial. Extra time on the exam will not be
awarded for this situation.
