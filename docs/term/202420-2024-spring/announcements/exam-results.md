# Exam and Lab Test Results

Exam and lab test solutions are published after one week. Once the solutions
are available, be sure to reconcile any missed questions on the exam and failed
test cases on the lab test. On the exam, if after seeing the correct answers
you still don't understand why your response is incorrect, be sure to locate
the lecture notes or other instructional resource where this question topic was
covered. If you still have confusion about the question and its correct answer,
please discuss this with me or a course TA.
