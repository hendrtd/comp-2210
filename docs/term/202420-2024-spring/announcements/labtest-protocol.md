# Lab Test Protocol

Here is the protocol you must follow during the lab test.

- Backpacks must be put at the front of the room during the test. You can’t
keep your backpack at your seat during the test.

- Phones, tablets, smart watches, and other similar devices must be put away
during the test. You can’t have these devices out during the test.

- You can take the test using either the lab machine or your own laptop.

- You can complete the programming task either in the Vocareum editor or in the
IDE of your choice on your own laptop.

- Just as with assignments, you are allowed unlimited submissions to Vocareum
and your score will be based strictly on the percentage of test cases passed.

- You can take a few sheets of the provided scratch paper if you like. You will
have to turn in the scratch paper before you leave the test.

- The test is closed-book, closed-notes, closed-Google, etc. In general, no
resources may be consulted or used during the test except for the Java API at
the following link: [Java
API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/index.html) If other
resources are allowed, they will be announced by the TA and instructions on how
to access them will be given.

- All work on the test must be done from within the lab during your scheduled
lab time. Violations of this rule will be treated as academic dishonesty.

- When you have submitted the test, you must sign out with the TA before you
can leave the lab.

- If you need to use the restroom during the test, just let your TA know where
you’re going. Do not close your browser; leave it open until you return.

- If you are using a lab machine, be sure to log in immediately once you've
taken your seat. Note that if this is the first time you've logged into a lab
machine, start-up time will be substantial. Extra time on the test will not be
awarded for this situation.
