# Welcome to COMP 2210 Fall 2022!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's also one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this semester!  

The first lecture will be on Tuesday, August 16 from 8:00 AM CT - 9:15 AM CT in
Shelby 1103 for the Campus sections (001-004) and in Zoom ID `867 4451 0711` for
the Distance section (D01). Labs will begin on Tuesday, August 23 from 9:30 AM
CT - 10:45 AM CT in the designated Shelby computer labs for Campus sections and
in Zoom ID `TBA` for the Distance section. Please refer to the course syllabus
for details on instructional modality, course policies, grading and more.

See you on Tuesday, and War Eagle!
