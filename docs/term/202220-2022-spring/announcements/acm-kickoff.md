# ACM Kick-Off Event - January 24, 6:00 PM, Shelby 1103

I encourage you to get involved with the Auburn student chapter of the
[Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/) (ACM). 

AU ACM offers the chance to connect with other students interested in computing
and software, build new friendships, learn new skills, and network with company
representatives that often come for ACM events. AU ACM has several affiliated
groups such as the Ethical Hacking Club, Competitive Programming Team, and CS
Makerspace Club for those with specialized interests.

The ACM is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society and
is one of the primary professional organizations for computer scientists and
software engineers. Although you can participate in AU ACM activities without
being a member of the global ACM organization, I encourage you to consider
student membership in ACM, which carries [many
benefits](https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-benefits). Student
membership is reasonably priced, and you can join here:
