# Getting Started With Honorlock

This course uses the [HonorLock](https://honorlock.com/) proctoring system for
exams. All fees associated with using HonorLock are being paid by Auburn
University this term, so there is no software to purchase or licensing fee for
you to pay. You ​do not need to create an account or schedule an appointment
in advance. 

## Requirements

The following things are required for you to use HonorLock.

- A laptop or desktop computer.
- A working webcam (integrated or external USB device).
- [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) with the [HonorLock extension installed](www.honorlock.com/extension/install).

For detailed information on HonorLock please read the 
[minimum system requirements](https://honorlock.com/support/) and the information provided
[for students](https://honorlock.com/students/).


## Taking an Exam or Test

When you are ready to take an exam or test, log into Canvas, go to your
course, and click on your exam or test. Clicking ​**Launch Proctoring**​ will
begin the Honorlock authentication process, where you will take a picture of
yourself, show your ID, and complete a scan of your room. Honorlock will be
recording your exam session by webcam as well as recording your screen.
Honorlock also has an integrity algorithm that can detect search-engine use,
so please do not attempt to search for answers, even if it's on a secondary
device.

Honorlock support is available 24/7/365. If you encounter any issues, you may
contact us by live chat, phone (​844-243-2500​), and/or email
(​`support@honorlock.com`​).


## Best Practices

Here are recommended best-practices for taking exams with HonorLock.

- Create a [different profile in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824) for taking exams instead of using your normal browsing/work profile.
- Install the HonorLock extension prior to each exam and uninstall it after each exam is over.
- Select a location and time that will help ensure your environment is as quiet and distraction-free as possible to take your exam.
- Ensure you have a stable network connection with sufficient bandwidth before starting your exam.
- Use your Auburn University [Tiger Card](http://www.auburn.edu/administration/tigercard/index.html) as your official photo ID as required by Honorlock. Only if you don't have your Tiger Card with your photo on it will you need to use a government-issued ID such as a driver's license, passport, or military ID.


## Taking a Practice Quiz

Be sure to take the practice HonorLock quiz on the following page to ensure
you are familiar with the process that you will be required to use for a real
exam. You may also find the
