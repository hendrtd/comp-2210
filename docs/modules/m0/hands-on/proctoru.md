# Getting Started with ProctorU

**DEPRECATED: NOT USED BEGINNING FALL 2022**

Students in the Distance section *must* use the
[ProctorU](https://www.proctoru.com/) proctoring software to take all course
exams.  Students in Campus sections *may* be required to use ProctorU for
make-up exams and for regular exams if the University were to transition to
remote operations.  It is important that all students in the course are familiar
with ProctorU and are able to use it.

ProctorU is not installed in the computer labs, so you can only use it on your
own computer. Students enrolled in a Campus section who are unable to install
and use ProctorU on a computer must contact their instructor during the first
week of classes.

Before starting, please review the ProctorU [equipment
requirements](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011772748-Equipment-Requirements)
and [internet
connection](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035774711-Internet-Connection-Bandwidth)
requirements.

## Up-Front Steps Before Taking Any ProctorU Exam

1. Register for a ProctorU account as a Test-Taker:

   Skip this step if you have already registered as a Test-Taker for another
   course.

1. Install and/or upgrade to the latest version of either
   [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or
   [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

## Steps To Take For a Specific ProctorU Exam (like this one...)

1. Close all applications other than your selected web browser.

1. Ensure that there is only one open tab on your browser and that tab has this
   course in Canvas loaded.

1. Sit at a clean desk or table, not a bed or couch.

1. Ensure that there is no music, televisions, etc. playing in the background.

1. Ensure that the room is well-lighted with no light source directly behind
   you.

1. Ensure that no other person is in the room during the exam. Communication
   with others during the exam is always prohibited. 

1. Ensure that no device other that the test-taking computer is present or in
   use. Secondary monitors, computers, phones, headphones, smartwatches, etc.
   are not permitted in any exam.

1. Remain visible in the camera for the duration of the exam. The only allowable
   exception is for a restroom break.

1. Have a valid photo ID prepared to show the camera. Your [AU Tiger
   Card](http://www.auburn.edu/administration/tigercard/) is the recommended and
   preferred ID. Other valid IDs include a driver license or passport.

1. When prompted to do a room scan, make a complete 360-degree rotation of the
   testing environment with slow, steady motion. Be sure to include the work
   area itself (your desk or table).

1. Once you are prepared, click the *Take the Quiz* button to take the exam.
