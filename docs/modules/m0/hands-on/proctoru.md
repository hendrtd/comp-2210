# Getting Started with ProctorU

Students in the Distance section *must* use the
[ProctorU](https://www.proctoru.com/) proctoring software to take all course
exams.  Students in Campus sections *may* be required to use ProctorU for
make-up exams and for regular exams if the University were to transition to
remote operations.  It is important that all students in the course are familiar
with ProctorU and are able to use it.

ProctorU is not installed in the computer labs, so you can only use it on your
own computer. Students enrolled in a Campus section who are unable to install
and use ProctorU on a computer must contact their instructor during the first
week of classes.

Before starting, please review the ProctorU [equipment
requirements](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011772748-Equipment-Requirements)
and [internet
connection](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035774711-Internet-Connection-Bandwidth)
requirements.
