# Getting Started With Discord

This course uses [Discord](https://discord.com/) as a highly interactive course
forum. Discord provides an efficient way to ask and answer questions, discuss
course topics (and off-course topics), and - most importantly - develop a sense
of **community** in the class.

Once the Discord server is ready, you'll receive a Canvas announcement with
instructions on joining. So, nothing to do right now!
