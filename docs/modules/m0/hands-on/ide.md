# Hands-On: Development Environment

To complete the work in this course you will need a **development
environment** -- a collection of tools with which you build software.
Development environments range from the small and simple to the large and
complex, but at the core of each is the
[compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) and 
[runtime system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system) of the programming
language being used. At a minimum, a development environment must provide the
tools necessary for you to write a program as a 
[text file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file), translate the program into an
executable form, and then run/execute the program on a computer. For the
purposes of this course it will be important to choose a development that is a
["Goldilocks fit"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) for you
-- not too little, not too much, but just right.

There is quite of bit of material here, so you can jump to a particular section through the following list.

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

The Java Development Kit
([JDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit)) is a computing
platform for developing and deploying software written in
[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). This course
will use the [Java SE
Platform](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/platform-glance.html),
which includes the language, compiler, debugger, runtime environment, and
extensive software libraries - everything you need to develop software in
Java, except for an editor to create source code text files.

To work on your own computer, you must download and install the Java SE JDK
from 
[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html)
or the [essentially identical](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later)
open source [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/). The latest release of the JDK is
recommended, although version 7 or above will be sufficient for this course.

Here are direct links to the latest Java SE JDK downloads from both Oracle and OpenJDK.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An integrated development environment
([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) is a
software application that provides access within a single interface to a
variety of tools such as an editor, compiler, debugger, runtime environment,
and so on.

While there are many IDEs available for Java, here are some that I can recommend.

### jGRASP

[jGRASP](https://jgrasp.org/) is a lightweight IDE developed at Auburn and used in hundreds of schools across the world. It is designed with education in mind, and strives to be simple but complete. [Object viewers](https://jgrasp.org/viewers.html) are unique to jGRASP and offer dynamic visualization of program execution during debug mode. jGRASP is freely available from [https://jgrasp.org/](https://jgrasp.org/).

### IntelliJ

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) ("IntelliJ") is a modern,
professional IDE and is the basis for Google's Android Studio. It is one of the "big
three" IDEs for Java along with Eclipse and NetBeans. As fitting a professional-grade
tool, IntelliJ is large, complex, and comes with a learning curve, but it is a
powerful tool. 
The [Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=983211)
of IntelliJ is freely available 
from [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).

A [jGRASP plugin for IntelliJ](https://jgrasp.org/ij_plugin.html) is available
to provide the object viewers from within the IntelliJ environment. 

### Eclipse

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), is a large, complex, professional IDE that
offers a lot of power and flexibility but, of course, comes with a steep learning 
curve. Eclipse is freely available 
from [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

A [jGRASP plugin for Eclipse](https://jgrasp.org/eclipse_plugin.html) is available
to provide the object viewers from within the Eclipse environment. 

### Online IDE provided by Vocareum

[Vocareum](https://www.vocareum.com/), the cloud-based auto-grading tool that
we will use in this course, provides a simple IDE. You will be required to use
this IDE for the lab tests, and you can use this IDE for the programming
assignments if you like. More details and instructions regarding Vocareum will be provided in a separate activity.


## Editor + Command Line

While IDEs can provide convenience and power, there are reasons that you might
want to use a small set of separate tools rather than an integrated
environment.

- Using an IDE can obscure what lower-level tools are being used when a program is compiled, executed, tested, and debugged.
- Using an IDE can confuse the separation between a program, the IDE, the language, and the different tools being used.
- Being able to work at the command line with fundamental programming tools is important.

The minimum tools necessary to work in this mode are an editor, a Java
compiler, a Java runtime environment, and a terminal/shell/command-line
window.

### Text Editors

A good text editor can be used for far more than programming, and this is
another advantage of going this route. Once you get comfortable with a
powerful text editor, you'll want to use it for most everything.

#### Sublime and Atom

Sublime Text and Atom are modern, powerful text editors that are very similar
in functionality but dramatically different in implementation. 

[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is implemented in C++ and Python and 
offers significant speed even under heavy workloads. Sublime is a
closed-source project developed by a small private company (Sublime HQ) in
Australia. A limited version of Sublime is available for free, but the full
version - with all the nice features you really want - must be purchased.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is implemented using web technologies  (Chromium,
JavaScript, CoffeeScript, etc.) and sacrifices speed for extreme customization
capabilities ("hackable" is the term used by its developers). Atom is an
open-source project developed by GitHub and maintained by a large developer
base. Atom is completely free.

Both Sublime and Atom are supported by extensive package managers that allow
features to be added and removed. Certain collections of features can offer a
level of tool integration that can feel like a simple IDE.

#### Emacs and vi
 
Emacs and vi are the old guard of text editors, each with its own legion of 
devoted followers who keep the [editor war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war)
coals smoldering to this day. This is Marvel-D.C., Hamilton-Burr, Coke-Pepsi. 
This is Auburn-Alabama, Michigan-Ohio State, Army-Navy. If one had oak trees, 
the other would have poisoned them. Think I'm kidding or exaggerating? 
[I'm not.](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ChurchOfEmacs)

Hyperbole and drama aside, both [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) 
and vi (now [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)) are extremely powerful, 
extremely stable, and simply excellent text editors. Anyone who considers 
themselves a programmer or who wants to be one should give both a try, 
and be able to at least write a 
[Hello World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) in each.


### Command Line

The [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) 
is a text-based interface to your computer's operating system. Terms such as 
*command prompt*, *[terminal](https://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line/506628#506628)*, 
*[shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29#Text_.28CLI.29_shells)*, 
*shell prompt*, and others are often used interchangeably, but for our purposes 
I'll just use **command line**.

Both [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) and 
[Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/linux/) 
distributions provide a command line interface through built-in terminal applications: 
[macOS Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac), 
[Ubuntu terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview). 
Terminal applications can be added to 
Microsoft [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), 
including the 
[Ubuntu terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview)
for Windows 10 
through [Ubuntu on Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

Here are two good resources for learning to work with the command line.

- [https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash)
- [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)

And finally, [makefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) are very helpful if you work at the command line. Here's a good tutorial: [https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html).
