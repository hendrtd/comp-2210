# Hands-On: Development Environment

To complete the work in this course you will need a **development environment** - a collection of  tools that allow you to build software. Development environments range from the small and simple to the very large and complex, but at the core of each is the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) and [runtime system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system) of the programming language being used. At a minimum, a development environment must provide the tools necessary for you to write a program as a [text file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file), translate the program into an executable form, and then run/execute the program on a computer. For the purposes of this course it's important to choose a development that is a ["Goldilocks fit"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) for you - not too little, not too much, but just right.

After the discussion below I offer a suggestion of how you might make your choice of a development environment for this course.


## Java Development Kit (JDK)


## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)


## ... or a good Editor


## Testing Framework - JUnit


## Style Auditor - Checkstyle


## Source Control - Git


## Which environment is right for you?
