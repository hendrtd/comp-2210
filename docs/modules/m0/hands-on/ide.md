# Hands-On: Development Environment

To complete the work in this course you will need a **development
environment** -- a collection of  tools with which you build software.
Development environments range from the small and simple to the very large and
complex, but at the core of each is the
[compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) and 
[runtime system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system) of the programming
language being used. At a minimum, a development environment must provide the
tools necessary for you to write a program as a 
[text file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file), translate the program into an
executable form, and then run/execute the program on a computer. For the
purposes of this course it's important to choose a development that is a
["Goldilocks fit"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) for you
-- not too little, not too much, but just right.

After the discussion below I offer a suggestion of how you might make your choice of a development environment for this course.


## Java Development Kit (JDK)

The Java Development Kit
([JDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit)) is a computing
platform for developing and deploying software written in
[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). This course
will use the [Java SE
Platform](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/platform-glance.html),
which includes the language, compiler, debugger, runtime environment, and
extensive software libraries - everything you need to develop software in
Java, except for an editor to create source code text files.

To work on your own computer, you must download and install the Java SE JDK
from either
[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html)
or the [essentially identical](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later)
open source [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/). The latest release is
recommended, although version 7 or above will be sufficient for this course.

Here are direct links to the latest Java SE JDK downloads from both Oracle and OpenJDK.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An integrated development environment
([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) is a
software application that provides access within a single interface to a
variety of tools such as an editor, compiler, debugger, runtime environment,
and so on.

While there are many IDEs available for Java, here are three that I can recommend.

### jGRASP

[jGRASP](https://jgrasp.org/) is a lightweight IDE developed at Auburn and used in hundreds of schools across the world. It is designed with education in mind, and strives to be simple but complete. [Object viewers](https://jgrasp.org/viewers.html) are unique to jGRASP and offer dynamic visualization of program execution during debug mode. jGRASP is freely available from [https://jgrasp.org/](https://jgrasp.org/).

### IntelliJ

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) ("IntelliJ") is a modern,
professional IDE and is the basis for Google's Android Studio. It is one of the "big
three" IDEs for Java along with Eclipse and NetBeans. As fitting a professional-grade
tool, IntelliJ is large, complex, and comes with a learning curve, but it is a
powerful tool. 
The [Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=983211)
of IntelliJ is freely available 
from [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).

A [jGRASP plugin for IntelliJ](https://jgrasp.org/ij_plugin.html) is available
to provide the object viewers from within the IntelliJ environment. 

### Eclipse

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), is a large, complex, professional IDE that
offers a lot of power and flexibility but, of course, comes with a steep learning 
curve. Eclipse is freely available 
from [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

A [jGRASP plugin for Eclipse](https://jgrasp.org/eclipse_plugin.html) is available
to provide the object viewers from within the Eclipse environment.
