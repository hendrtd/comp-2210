# Getting Started With Piazza

This course uses the [Piazza](https://piazza.com) web-based Q&A platform.
Piazza is an efficient way for you to ask a question and have it answered.
Particularly for a large class, the average time between a question being
asked and it being answered is far shorter than had the question been asked in
an email to the course instructional staff.

Once a question is posted, any of the instructional staff can respond and any
student in the class can respond as well. Piazza follows a wiki-style approach
in that for any question there will be at most one "instructor" answer and at
most one "student answer." Multiple instructors can chime in, but each edits
the single instructor answer rather than adding another. Same for students -
multiple students can respond, but each edits the single student answer rather
than adding another. Follow-ups can be added when something more than an edit
to an answer is needed, or when a related question needs to be asked. Once the
entire class buys in to asking and answering questions on Piazza, it becomes
very efficient and very effective.
