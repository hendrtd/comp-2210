## Getting Started With Vocareum

Vocareum provides online virtual labs to support various course scenarios, including the programming lab environment that we will be using in this course. Using Vocareum requires a subscription fee of $20, to be paid online before the end of the current semester's grace period (September 2). Do **not** go to the Vocareum website directly to sign up or pay. Instead, your Vocareum account will be automatically created when you access the Vocareum activity on the next page in this module. This will not only activate your Vocareum account, but it will also link your Vocareum account to your Canvas account, and will automatically post the scores you earn in Vocareum to the Canvas gradebook for this course.
