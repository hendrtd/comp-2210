## Getting Started With Vocareum

Vocareum provides online virtual labs to support various course scenarios,
including the programming lab environment that we will be using in this
course. Using Vocareum requires a subscription fee that will be charged
directly to your eBill via 
Auburn's 
[All Access](https://www.aubookstore.com/t-Textbook_AllAccess.aspx)
program. 
Do **not** go to the Vocareum website directly to sign up or pay. Instead,
your Vocareum account will be automatically created when you access the
Vocareum activity on the next page in this module and enter the access code
that was given to you in an email from the AU Bookstore. This will not only
activate your Vocareum account, but it will also link your Vocareum account to
your Canvas account, and will automatically post the scores you earn in
Vocareum to the Canvas gradebook for this course.

The next page in this module steps you through your first interaction with
Vocareum.
