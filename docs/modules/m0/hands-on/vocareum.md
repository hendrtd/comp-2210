# Hands-On: Vocareum

## Overview and Access

[Vocareum](https://www.vocareum.com/) provides various online virtual lab
environments, including the *programming lab* environment that we will be using
in this course. Using Vocareum requires a subscription fee that will be charged
directly to your eBill via Auburn's [All
Access](https://www.aubookstore.com/t-Textbook_AllAccess.aspx) program.  Do
**not** go to the Vocareum website directly to sign up or pay. Instead, your
Vocareum account will be automatically created when you access the Vocareum
activity on the next page in this module and enter the access code that was
given to you in an email from the AU Bookstore. This will not only activate your
Vocareum account, but it will also link your Vocareum account to your Canvas
account, and will automatically post the scores you earn in Vocareum to the
Canvas gradebook for this course.

## Submission

The submission page for this activity asks you to interact with a source code
file in Vocareum, make changes to this file, and then submit it for a grade.
