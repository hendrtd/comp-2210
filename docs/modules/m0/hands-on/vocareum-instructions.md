# Using Vocareum

This activity is designed to give you a first experience working with Vocareum
as you will for hands-on activities, assignments, and lab tests in this course.
When you click on the 'Open in new tab' button in Canvas, a separate browser tab
will open with this activity loaded in your Vocareum account. 

## Overview 

The Vocareum user interface for this activity is divided into three columns. The
left column is a **file browser**, the right column is an **information
display**, and the middle column contains a **program editor** (top pane) and a
**terminal/console** (bottom pane). Spanning the top of all three columns is a
panel with **action buttons**.

- **File browser**: Navigate the files and directories associated with the
  activity.  Available actions include *refresh* the files list, *upload* to the
  selected directory, *download* the selected directory or file, *copy* the
  selected directory or file, *delete* the selected file, create a *new* file or
  folder in the selected directory, and *rename* the selected file. Two
  directories (folders) are particularly relevant to your direct interaction:
    - `resource/startercode`: Contains files provided as part of the activity.
    - `work`: The current working directory for your activity. This directory
      contains the source code that you are currently editing and working with,
      plus associated files that may be accessed or generated. 
- **Information Display**: Displays an associated "readme" file (if one exists)
  or the most recent grade report (if available). While the most recent grade
  report must be explicitly loaded by clicking the *Grading Report* action
  button, the Information Display will automatically load the readme file. The
  readme can be explicitly loaded by clicking the *Readme* action button. If
  there is no readme file and no grade report, the Information Display will be
  collapsed and not visible.
- **Program Editor**: Provides a syntax-aware editor for Java. Clicking on a
  file in the file browser loads the file in the program editor.
- **Terminal/Console**: Provides a command line interface to a Linux virtual
  machine on which all your work is being done. Since this is a full console
  running [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), you may like
  to work directly at the command line. The terminal/console will always display
  anything printed to
  [`stdout`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams), including the
  output of submission and grading scripts.
- **Action Buttons**: Provide actions available for the activity in Vocareum.
  Most of the actions have been described above in the context of the user
  interface; here are the remaining actions:
    - **Submit**: Submits the currently-saved files in the `work` directory for
      grading. Each activity, assignment, and lab test allows unlimted
      submissions, so you can submit as often as you like. Note that a side
      effect of this action is that the Information Display is changed to show
      the resulting grading report.
    - **Build**: This action is currently not functioning, so do not click
      Build. Just click Submit.
    - **Submission Report**: Raises a pop-up window displaying the results of
      the most recent submission.
    - **Grading Report**: Raises a pop-up window displaying the results of the
      grading of the most recent submission. This often results in a message
      stating that there is no report available, but that's ok. Full grade
      information is available using the next action button...
    - **Grades**: Causes the Information Display to load the grading rubric and
      scores for the most recent submission. 
    - **Reset**: Deletes all content in the `work` directory and replaces it
      with the original files in `resource/startercode`.
    - **Full Screen**: (Icon) Maximizes the browser window to full screen.

When first loading this activity in Vocareum, the interface should look
essentially like the following:

member.


## Getting Started With the Activity

The overall goal of this activity is for you to get comfortable completing
programming activities and having them graded by Vocareum. The specific task for
which a grade will be assigned is modifying the `WarEagle` class so that it
passes all test cases and earns full points.

1. The source code file `WarEagle.java` should be already loaded in the editor,
   but if it is not, open the `work` folder in the file browser and click on the
   `WarEagle.java` file.
2. Click on **Submit**. You will be prompted to confirm your submission. Before
   doing so, recall that making a submission will cause the Information Display
   to show the grading report, and these instructions will no longer be visible.
   To see these instructions again, simply click on the Readme action button.
   Now click **Yes** to confirm your submission.
3. Notice the effect in the Information Display and the terminal/console. Be
   sure you understand the correspondence between the output shown in the
   terminal and the scores shown in the grading rubric.
4. Click on **Submission Report** to see the results of running the submission
   and grading script. Be sure that you understand how you can use the contents
   of the submission report as a guide to modifying the source code.
5. At this point you probably want to click on **Readme** so that these
   instructions are once again in the Information Display.

Now your task is to modify the `WarEagle` source code to make it pass all tests
and earn the full points available. You can do this completely within the
Vocareum environment or you can do the programming, testing, and debugging on
your own machine and simply use Vocareum for grading. To work completley within
Vocareum, simply use the programming editor (or vim in the terminal/console) to
edit the file and then submit as often as you want. If you prefer to work on
your own machine, then download the source code, work in the editor/IDE of your
choice on your own machine, and then upload and submit as often as you like. I
think you will find that each approach is suited to different situations and
that you will want to be comfortable using either approach. For example, many
hands-on activities (like this one) and lab tests are more easily done all
within Vocareum, while almost all assignments are better done on your own
machine using the IDE of your choice.

Spend some time practicing both approaches. Be sure to make a few intentional
mistakes, including syntax errors, so that you get comfortable with the way that
submissions to Vocareum work and with the feedback that you receive after each
submission. Remember that you can use the **Reset** action button to revert back
to the starter code; this might make repeated practice easier.
