## Using Vocareum

This activity is designed to give you a first experience with working with Vocareum as you will for assignments in this course.

1. Download the source code file `WarEagle.java` to your local machine.
2. Click the 'Open in new tab' button below to open this activity in Vocareum. (**Note:** You may want to switch back and forth between this tab and the Vocareum tab, although the following instructions are also provided in Vocareum.)
3. Click on the "My Work" button for this activity.
4. Click on the "work" folder in the left pane.
5. Click on the "Upload" button at the top of the left pane.
6. Select the WarEagle.java file that you saved earlier.
7. Click on the "work" folder and then the WarEagle.java file to load it in the Vocareum editor pane.
8. Click on the "Instructions" button to see these steps repeated in Vocareum.
9. Click on the "Submit" button at the top of the Vocareum window and then click "Yes" to confirm.
10. Notice the effect in three areas of the Vocareum window:
	- The terminal pane the bottom of the window is an interactive shell on the Linux VM that is running JUnit test cases on the WarEagle class. It shows the results printed to standard out from running these tests. (Note that you can interact with this terminal window and issue commands.)
	- The "Details" drop-down menu offers access to a Submission Report and a Grading Report. Be sure to look at each. The Submission Report will be the most valuable to you when working with an actual assignment.
	- The right pane displays the scores earned by the submission.
11. Modify the WarEagle source code to make it pass all tests and earn the full points available.
	- You can do this directly in the Vocareum editor or in the IDE of your choice on your own machine.
	- To practice how you will do things on an assignment, I suggest you edit everything and just upload each new version and submit.
12. Make a few mistakes, including syntax errors, so that you get comfortable with the way that submissions to Vocareum work and with the feedback that you receive.
13. Finally, make sure you have the code pass all the test cases so that you earn full credit for this activity.
