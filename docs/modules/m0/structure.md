# Course Structure

This course is organized into eight modules numbered
[zero](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html)
through seven. Module 0 is an introductory "getting started" module, while
Module 1 through Module 7 are course-content modules. Rather than being
organized strictly by content, these modules are
[timeboxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing); that is, M1 -- M7 are
of fixed, equal durations with specific tasks to be completed within each. (If
you're familiar with 
[agile methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_developmenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)),
you'll recognize similarities to
[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) sprints.)

Scheduling, planning, and knowing when things are due is easy with timeboxed
modules. All graded items are scheduled to be due or delivered on module
boundaries. Specifically:

- Each assignment is due on the last day of the module that contains it.
- Each hands-on activity is due on the last day of the module that contains it.
- Each exam is given immediately after the last day of the module that contains it.
- Each lab test is given immediately after the last day of the module that contains it.

This overall course structure is the same regardless of course delivery mode
(in-person or online) or term (15-week fall/spring, 10-week summer, or 7.5
week half-term). Module 0 begins on the first day of classes for the term and
ends on the first Sunday of the term. Modules 1-7 each begin on a Monday and
ends on a Sunday. The duration of each module 1-7 is the same but varies by
term (14 days for fall/spring, 10 days for summer, and 7 days for half-term).

Here is the specific schedule for [Fall 2020](http://www.auburn.edu/main/auweb_calendar.php).

Module 7 has less content to account for final exam preparation and other end
of term issues.
