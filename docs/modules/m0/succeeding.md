# Working Hard

The [Auburn Creed](http://www.auburn.edu/main/welcome/creed.php) is woven into
the fabric of Auburn University, and it expresses important ideals and values
that are closely held by the Auburn Family. When it comes to succeeding in
this course, three lines from the Creed are particularly relevant.

## Hard Work

> I believe that this is a practical world and that I can count only on what I
earn. Therefore, I believe in work, hard work. 

Success in this class will require you to work hard. You will need to
discipline yourself to keep up with the lectures, activities, and assignments,
and doing that will require good time management. The first part of this
course will emphasize a systematic, disciplined approach to developing code,
so you will need to take that seriously and apply it to your own work.

And don't forget that learning this material requires practice. You can't just
read it or watch it, you have to do it. There are Hands-On Activities in each
module that encourage you to practice, but take other opportunities to
practice as well. What separates truly great athletes and musicians from
ordinary ones? More than anything else, it's the hard work of practice. It is
exactly the same with software developers. It takes practice to master the
required skills and knowledge and to truly excel.

## Honest Work

> I believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot win the
respect and confidence of my fellow men. 

Success in this course is much more than earning a good grade. It's about
truly mastering the content. Often we get too focused on grades and make them
our end goal in a course. This is a mistake for several reasons, and one in
particular is that this outlook can tempt us to cut corners and turn in work
that isn't completely our own. Be sure to do your own work. I encourage you to
help each other learn, but there is a line where help crosses over into
academic dishonesty. Never share your code with other people, and never use
code that isn't your own.

## Personal Engagement

> I believe in the human touch, which cultivates sympathy with my fellow men
and mutual helpfulness and brings happiness for all. 

The most successful course experiences involve meaningful *engagement* by 
students. Seeing learning as an active process in which you have a significant
share of the responsibility is an important perspective. Beyond that though,
there are some very concrete things you can do:

- Use Piazza to ask questions that you have regarding anything in the course.
- Use Piazza to answer questions and engage with other students in the course.
- Attend labs, engage with the TA and with your classmates.
- Attend lecture, ask questions, engage with the instructor and your classmates.
- This will allow you to share individual perspectives and ideas that will allow the group to construct understanding that wouldn't have been possible alone.


# Working Smart

Hard work is important but smart, efficient work is important as well.
Combining hard work - doing all the work you need to do - with efficient work
- avoiding wasted time and effort - is a powerful and effective combination.

Here are some actions that can lead to smart, efficient work:

- Practice good [time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management).
- Develop a personal [workflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow).
- Take control of your own learning via [self-regulated learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulated_learning) and [metacognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition).
- [Space out study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect) sessions and [avoid cramming](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn).


# Theory and Practice

> Theory and practice are not mutually exclusive; they are intimately connected. They live together and support each other. Computer science is a field where theory and practice come together more than in any other discipline, because of the nature of computing machines.
