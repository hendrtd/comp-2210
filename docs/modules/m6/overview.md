# Hash Tables and Graphs

This module provides a terminal point for part of the course material, and a
launching pad for advanced material that is beyond the scope of this course.
**Hash tables** are the most complicated and most efficient search structure
presented in the course. The *O(1)* time complexity offered by hash tables is
not straightforward to achieve, and it comes only after making a trade-off in
return. In one sense, hash tables represents the ultimate search structure and
is thus a terminal point on the searching thread that we have carried for much
of the course. But as that thread ends, we pick up an exciting new thread with
graphs. **Graphs** are *models* rather than *collections*. That is, we can
model a particular scenario as a graph and then mine the graph for answers to
interesting and important questions. Although the full capabilities of graphs
are far beyond the scope of this course, the material that we cover will give
you a glimpse of the power that these models open up for us.
