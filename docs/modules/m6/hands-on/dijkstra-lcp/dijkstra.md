# Hands-On: Dijkstra's Least-Cost Path Algorithm

This activity focuses on the fundamental mechanics of applying Dijkstra's
Least-Cost Path algorithm to a directed, weighted graph.


## Computing least-cost paths

1. Open the lecture notes on Least-Cost Path Algorithms.

1. Review the note set to refresh your memory on Dijkstra's LCP algorithm.

1. Go to the slides that illustrate the step-by-step operation of Dijkstra's algorithm on a given graph.

1. Go through each step of this algorithm in the slides and make sure you understand how it works.


## Submission

The submission page for this activity asks you to apply your understanding of
Dijkstra's Algorithm to a problem and then submit it for a grade.
