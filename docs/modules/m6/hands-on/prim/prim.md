# Hands-On: Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

This activity focuses on the fundamental mechanics of applying Prim's Minimum
Spanning Tree algorithm to an undirected, weighted graph.


## Computing a minimum spanning tree

1. Open the lecture notes on Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms.

1. Review the note set to refresh your memory on Prim's MST algorithm.

1. Go to the slides that illustrate the step-by-step operation of Prim's algorithm on a given graph.

1. Go through each step of this algorithm in the slides and make sure you understand how it works.


## Submission

The submission page for this activity asks you to apply your understanding of
Prim's Algorithm to a problem and then submit it for a grade.
