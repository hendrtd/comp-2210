# Hands-On: Hash Tables

This activity focuses on the fundamental mechanics of adding new values to a
hash table using different collision resolutions strategies.


## Adding values

1. Open the lecture notes on Hash Tables.

1. Review the note set to refresh your memory on this data structure.

1. Go to the slides that illustrate adding to an open addressed hash table the following sequence of hashcodes: 35, 22, 18, 94, 56, 12, 6

1. Go through each add operation in the slides using linear probing for collision resolution, and make sure you understand how each works.

1. Go through each add operation in the slides using double hashing for collision resolution, and make sure you understand how each works.


## Submission

The submission page for this activity asks you to apply your understanding of
hash tables to a problem and then submit it for a grade.
