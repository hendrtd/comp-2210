# Succeeding in This Module

This module introduces **hash tables** and **graphs**. As always, this module
builds on all the content from the previous module. Succeeding in this module
will require good time management and a commitment to applying the concepts
that you are learning. You are encouraged to do the hands-on activities as you
watch the lecture videos. They are designed to give you practice with ideas
being discussed in the videos and with skills required for the assignment. You
are also encouraged to begin the assignment as soon as possible. Give yourself
plenty of time to complete the assignment in stages rather than waiting until
just before it is due.

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts and gets
progressively more difficult. It is important to be proactive and to begin
your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you don't
understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for
help sooner rather than later. Ask questions on Piazza and participate in
discussions. Engaging with the class and being proactive are good strategies
for success.
