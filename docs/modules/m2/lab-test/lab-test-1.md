# Lab Test 1

This lab test is designed to test your programming *fluency* by having you
develop the solution to two small, focused problems in Java. You must complete
the bodies of the indicated methods in the starter code provided in Vocareum.

## Rules

- You must complete the lab test within 75 minutes from when you begin and
  before the end of the availability period.

- You are allowed an unlimited number of submissions to Vocareum during the time
  you are taking the lab test.

- Your grade will be determined solely on the basis of the percentage of test
  cases passed on submissions recorded in Vocareum.

- Your lab test must reflect your independent work with no outside help, and you
  will be held responsible for observing the [Academic Honesty
  Code](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/academic-honesty/_assets/pdf/academic-honesty-code-20201028.pdf).

- You are allowed to reference the Java API at the following link:
  [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html).
  You are not allowed to reference any other material during the lab test.

- You are strongly encouraged to take the lab test completely within the
  Vocareum environment. However, you are allowed to use the IDE of your choice
  and download/upload the lab test code as needed. In either case, your grade
  will be based strictly on submissions recorded in Vocareum and not on your own
  machine.
