# Reflecting on the Module

This module has introduced algorithm analysis, sorting, recursion, and the
divide-and-conquer strategy. These are powerful tools that enable you to be a
better problem solver and a more discerning producer and consumer of code. 

Take time now to review and reflect on this module and the work you've done.

- What did you learn?
- How might this help you in upcoming modules?
- What are you still unsure about, and what questions do you have?
- Is there any work that you left undone? Is there still time to complete it?
- Are you satisfied with the way in which you completed this module, and with
  the way you managed your time?
- How might you improve your workflow and study habits for the next module?

Taking time to [reflect on your
experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice), rather than just
moving on, can be an important part of learning and getting better - not just in
school, but on the job and in life.
