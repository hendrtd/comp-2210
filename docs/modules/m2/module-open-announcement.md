# Module 2 Announcements

As you begin Module 2, here are a few things to keep in mind.

- Time management, as always, will be important. Be sure to set aside time each
  day to work on this course, and don’t try to get everything done in the one or
  two days before things are due.

- Although the module is laid out sequentially, it might be best to work through
  everything iteratively instead. I suggest starting with the lectures and
  lecture notes, and switching to a hands-on activities once that particular
  topic is covered in the notes. Likewise, once the material needed to complete
  the assignment has been covered in the lectures and you’ve completed the
  associated hands-on activities, start on the assignment. See the resource from
  Module 0 for a discussion of the suggested course workflow.

- An [active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning),
  [self-regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulated_learning)
  approach to learning in this course is crucial to your success. The passive
  activities we typically associate with "studying" (attendance, reading,
  listening, watching) are necessary, but they are not sufficient. For example:
  Don't just read the notes, **do** the notes - actually implement in code the
  algorithms and partial code being presented. 

- The assignment in this module is almost the same as the assignment from Module
  1. In fact, you're solving the *exact same problems*. The difference is in the
  level of abstraction and generality. Where before you dealt with arrays of
  `int` values, now you're dealing with `Collection`s of an unknown type. Be
  sure to take advantage of the fact that *linear scan* is still the solution to
  all seven methods.

- As in each module, the assignment and all hands-on activities are due no later
  than 11:59 PM CT on the last day of the module.

- Exam 1 and Lab Test 1 are each part of this module. Details concerning
  content, scheduling, and instructions will be sent in a separate announcement.
  Links to a practice exam and practice lab test will be in that announcement as
  well.

- Be sure to ask any questions that you have. The most efficient way to get
  general questions answered is by posting to the course Q&A forum.

Good luck, and War Eagle!
