# Efficiency, Sorting, Divide & Conquer, and Recursion

In this module, you will learn how to measure and describe the **efficiency**
of algorithms and source code. This is an important skill, because it enables
you to provide scalability guarantees to clients of your code, and it also
enables you to be a discerning client of others’ code. 

The module will also discuss **sorting** and explore four different algorithms
for solving this problem. As part of that exploration, you will learn a new
problem-solving strategy — **divide and conquer** — and a new way of
expressing your strategies in code — **recursion**. This will not only add to
your growing repertoire of solution patterns, but it will also illustrate the
gains that can be made by thinking about a problem in a very different way.
