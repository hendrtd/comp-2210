# Succeeding in This Module

This module introduces algorithm analysis, sorting, recursion, and a new
problem-solving strategy called divide and conquer. You will notice
immediately that this module builds on all the content from the previous
module. Succeeding in this module will require good time management and a
commitment to applying the concepts that you are learning. 

You are encouraged to do the hands-on activities as you go through the notes
and watch the lecture videos. They are designed to give you practice with
ideas being discussed in the note and videos and with skills required for the
assignment. You are also encouraged to begin the assignment as soon as
possible. Give yourself plenty of time to complete the assignment in stages
rather than waiting until just before it is due.

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts and gets
progressively more difficult. It is important to be proactive and to begin
your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you don't
understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for
help sooner rather than later. Ask questions on Piazza, engage with the class,
and be proactive.


# Module Objectives

- Apply empirical techniques to assess the time complexity of a Java method.
- Apply analytical techniques to assess the time complexity of an algorithm and/or Java method.
- Express the time complexity of an algorithm using Big - notation.
- Create experiments, generate data, and draw conclusions regarding the efficiency of Java programs from the analysis of the results of the experiments.
- Evaluate the suitability of a software component with respect to time complexity.
- Create Java programs that solve a problem while meeting specific time complexity requirements.
- Identify sorting algorithms given the time complexity and/or algorithmic profile.
- Apply sorting as part of a larger problem-solving strategy.
- Apply the divide-and-conquer strategy.
- Create recursive solutions to problems.
- Compare and contrast recursion and iteration.
