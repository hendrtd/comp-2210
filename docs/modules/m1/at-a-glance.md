# Succeeding in This Module

In this module, you will learn how to create robust solutions to problems and
express them in a general and reusable way. The module will address problem
solving through applying general solution patterns, writing rigorous tests for
the programs we create, and using the abstraction features in Java to write
generalized code. These are important skills that all software professionals
must master.

You are encouraged to do the hands-on activities as you watch the lecture
videos. They are designed to give you practice with ideas being discussed in
the videos and with skills required for the assignment. You are also
encouraged to begin the assignment as soon as possible. Give yourself plenty
of time to complete the assignment in stages rather than waiting until just
before it is due.

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts and gets progressively
more difficult. It is important to be proactive and to begin your work early in
the module to allow the material to sink in. If you don't understand something
or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for help sooner rather than
later. Ask questions, engage with the class, and be proactive. These are good
strategies for success.


# Module Objectives

- Apply the linear scan strategy to create solutions to problems in Java.
- Assess Java programs on the basis of best-practice coding styles.
- Create test cases to verify the functionality of programs written in Java.
- Apply standard testing tools to create and maintain test cases.
- Assess the efficacy of test cases.
- Assess the correctness of Java programs with respect to a set of test cases.
- Create reusable software components that are expressed at a high level of abstraction.
- Apply generic type parameters in Java.
- Create total orders for classes using the Comparable and Comparator interfaces.
- Apply the Iterator interface when creating a Java program.
- Compare and contrast the Iterator interface with the linear scan strategy.
