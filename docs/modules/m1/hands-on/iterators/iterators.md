# Hands-On: Iterators


## Iterators - Purpose and Overview

The *iterator pattern* is one of the most common programming patterns that we
use. It describes the standard solution to the common problem of accessing
every element of a collection in turn. We can think of the iterator pattern as
*linear scan* over a collection. Java provides the `Iterator` interface as the
standard means of expressing iteration. There are actually two interfaces
relevant to iteration: `Iterator` and `Iterable`. You can read more about each
at the following links.

- [`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Iterator.html`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Iterator.html)
- [`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Iterable.html`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Iterable.html)

The real power of an iterator is this: Through the `Iterator` interface, we
can traverse a collection of elements **without knowing exactly what the
collection is or how it is structured.** Now we can perform a linear scan on
... *anything*.

For us to iterate over something, that something will have to provide us with
an `Iterator` object over its elements. The standard (idiomatic) way of doing
that in Java is for the "something" to implement the `Iterable` interface,
thereby obliging it to provide a method named `iterator` that returns an
`Iterator` object over its elements. Let's say that this "something" is a
class named `AnIterableCollection`. Then the shell of the class must look
something like this:

```java
public class AnIterableCollection<T> implements Iterable<T> {
    // fields, methods, etc.
    public Iterator<T> iterator() {
        // create an Iterator object over the elements in this collection.
    }
}
```

Many of the collection classes in the 
[Java Collections Framework (JCF)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/doc-files/coll-overview.html)
are *iterable* so we can use `ArrayList` for an example. Suppose we have a
class named `Song` that models music that we listen to, and suppose we use an
`ArrayList` to create a playlist of songs for game day.

```java
ArrayList<Song> playlist = new ArrayList<>();
playlist.add(new Song("War Eagle"));
playlist.add(new Song("Welcome to the Jungle"));
playlist.add(new Song("All I Do Is Win"));
playlist.add(new Song("Sweet Caroline"));
```

Since the `ArrayList` class implements the `Iterable` interface, we can use
standard iteration patterns to play each song in our playlist. The `for-each`
loop is the standard idiom in Java for iterating over `Iterable` objects.

```java
for (Song song : playlist) {
    song.play();
}
```

The `for-each` loop is just a more compact form of the following more general pattern:

```java
Iterator<Song> itr = playlist.iterator();
while (itr.hasNext()) {
    itr.next().play();
}
```

For now we will mostly use one of these two patterns, but it's worth pointing
out that Java offers a feature called 
[lambda expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)
which provide us with a very compact iteration idiom.

```java
playlist.forEach(song -> song.play());
```

We will stick to the traditional patterns for this course, but features such
as lambda expressions and
[streams](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html) may be something you'd like to explore on your own.



## Iterators - an example

1. Open [`IteratorExample.java`](src/IteratorExample.java) in jGRASP and study the source code.
   - Notice the use of the iterator pattern in the `toString` method.
   - Notice that the parameter to `toString` is `Iterable`. This allows an instance of any class that implements the `Iterable` interface to be passed in.
   - Notice how the `main` method passes in four very different collections, but the iterator pattern abstracts away the differences. The `toString` method doesn't care what the specific collection actually is; it only cares that whatever collection is passed in is guaranteed to be `Iterable`.

1. Run `IteratorExample.java` and observe its output.

1. Use the provided jGRASP Canvas file ([`IteratorExample.jgrasp_canvas.xml`](src/IteratorExample.jgrasp_canvas.xml)) to watch the execution of this code. Once you save the jGRASP Canvas XML file to the same directory as the source code, you can use the jGRASP Canvas like so:
   - Click on the Canvas file in the jGRASP Browse tab or click on the *Run in Canvas* button ![](img/run_canvas.png) in the jGRASP tool bar.
   - Once the Canvas window opens, resize it so that it best fits your display.
   - You can use any of the following controls to watch the program execute.
      - *Play* ![](img/play.png) - Starts the program running in auto-step mode.
      - *Step Over* ![](img/step_over.png) - Manually steps over each statement.
      - *Step In* ![](img/step_in.png) - Manually steps into each statement (method call).

1. Study the source code again and make sure you understand how the `Iterator` interface allows a single method to traverse four distinct collection types.

1. Modify the body of the `toString` method so that it uses the `for-each` iterator idiom instead.


## Iterators - a common error

A common error in using iterators arises from a misunderstanding of what the
`next()` method actually does. You can identify and learn to correct this
common error through the steps below.

1. Open [`IteratorError.java`](src/IteratorError.java) in jGRASP and compile it.

1. Run `IteratorError.java` and observe its output.

1. Identify and correct the errors in use of the iterator. Hint: You may decide use a different expression for the iteration altogether to avoid the error.

1. It might help you identify the errors if you use the provided jGRASP Canvas file ([`IteratorError.jgrasp_canvas.xml`](src/IteratorError.jgrasp_canvas.xml)) in conjunction with the jGRASP debugger.


## Submission

The submission page for this activity asks you to submit your corrected `IteratorError.java` a grade.
