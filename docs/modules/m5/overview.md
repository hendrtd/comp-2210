# Search Trees and Binary Heaps

This module addresses performance and scalability head-on by introducing
specialized data structures to support both search and selection operations.
You will learn about **search trees**, data structures that guarantee O(log N)
time complexity on add, remove, and search operations, and you will also learn
about **binary heaps**, data structures that guarantee O(log N) time
complexity for add and remove, and O(1) time complexity for a specialized
selection operation.
