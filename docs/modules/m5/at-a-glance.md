# Succeeding in This Module

This module introduces two data structures specifically designed for
scalability and speed - **search trees** and **binary heaps**. Succeeding in
this module will require good time management and a commitment to applying the
concepts that you are learning. You are encouraged to do the Hands-On
activities as you watch the lecture videos. They are designed to give you
practice with ideas being discussed in the videos and with skills required for
the assignment. You are also encouraged to begin the assignment as soon as
possible. Give yourself plenty of time to complete the assignment in stages
rather than waiting until just before it is due.

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts and gets
progressively more difficult. It is important to be proactive and to begin
your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you don't
understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for
help sooner rather than later. Asking questions and engaging in the class are
good success strategies.
