# Module 4 Announcements

We've reached the half-way point in the course modules, and I hope you're
finding the experience fun, challenging, and rewarding. Module 4 focuses on
**lists**, **stacks**, and **queues** - some of the most ubiquitous
collections used in problem solving. We will also be introduced to two new
solution patterns - **breadth-first** and **depth-first search**.

Module 4 also contains the second exam and second lab test. All exams and
tests in this course are to some extent comprehensive, since the course
material builds upon itself, but the second exam and lab test will focus on
the material covered in Module 3 and Module 4. There will be separate announcements for the exam and lab test.

As you begin Module 4, here are a few things to keep in mind.

- Time management, as always, will be important. Be sure to set aside time each day to work on this course, and don’t try to get everything done in the one or two days before things are due.

- Although the module is laid out sequentially, it might be best to work through everything iteratively instead. I suggest starting with the lectures and lecture notes, and switching to a hands-on activities once that particular topic is covered in the notes. Likewise, once the material needed to complete the assignment has been covered in the lectures and you’ve completed the associated hands-on activities, start on the assignment. See the resource from Module 0 for a discussion of the suggested course workflow.

- An [active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning), [self-regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulated_learning) approach to learning in this course is crucial to your success. The passive activities we typically associate with "studying" (attendance, reading, listening, watching) are necessary, but they are not sufficient. For example: Don't just read the notes, **do** the notes - actually implement in code the algorithms and partial code being presented. 

- As in each module, the assignment and all hands-on activities are due no later than 11:59 PM CT on the last day of the module.

- Be sure to ask any questions that you have. The most efficient way to get general questions answered is by posting to Piazza. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need any help or have any questions.

Lot's of good stuff in this module! Have fun, and please do reach out if you
have questions or concerns.
