# Succeeding in This Module

This module introduces **lists**, **stacks**, and **queues**, along with
interesting applications and a more nuanced approach to collection design. As
always, this module builds on all the content from the previous module.
Succeeding in this module will require good time management and a commitment
to applying the concepts that you are learning. You are encouraged to do the
hands-on activities as you watch the lecture videos. They are designed to give
you practice with ideas being discussed in the videos and with skills required
for the assignment. You are also encouraged to begin the assignment as soon as
possible. Give yourself plenty of time to complete the assignment in stages
rather than waiting until just before it is due.

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts and gets
progressively more difficult. It is important to be proactive and to begin
your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you don't
understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for
help sooner rather than later. Asking questions, engaging with the class, and
being proactive are good strategies for success.
