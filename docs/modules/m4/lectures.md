# Lists

We begin this module by introducing a collection that embodies the notion of "order" - Lists. A List keeps all its elements in some prescribed order such as natural order, indexed order, or perhaps some other order that a given application demands. Since order is fundamentally important to many applications, Lists are some of the most widely used collections.


### Introduction

Lists keep things in order, but what exactly does "order" mean? Since it could mean a variety of things depending on the application, there has to be a variety of List collections.

### Array-based implementation

Now that we've discussed the abstract behavior of different list types, we need to understand how we can implement this behavior using a concrete data structure. These lecture materials introduce an array-based implementation of a List collection.

### Node-based implementation

Dynamically linked nodes are the standard alternative to arrays. These lecture materials discuss using singly-linked and doubly-linked nodes to implement a List collection.

### Performance analysis

How do these two alternative data structures perform with respect to time efficiency of the major List operations? These lecture materials provide an overview comparison and analysis.

# Stacks and Queues

### Introduction

Stacks and Queues can be viewed as special kinds of lists in which "order" is defined by time. Even so, the don't neatly fit into the List design we studied earlier, and so Stacks and Queues are typically thought of as collections that are related to but distinct from our conception of a List.

### Implementation alternatives

We now have several different implementation alternatives for stacks and queues. These lecture materials provide an overview of our options.

### Array-based stack

These lecture materials provide an overview of an array-based implementation of a Stack collection.

### Application - stack machine evaluation

Now that we've discussed the abstract behavior and concrete implementations of stacks and queues, these lecture materials explore an interesting application of both - stack machine evaluation.

# Breadth-first search and Depth-first search

Breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) are powerful search techniques that are also great applications of stacks and queues. The lecture video below gives a first introduction to these topics that we will revisit later in the course.
