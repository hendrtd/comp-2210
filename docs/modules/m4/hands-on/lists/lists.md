# Hands-On: Order In An Array-Based List

This activity is designed to reinforce your understanding of the operations
necessary to maintain order in an array-based collection. You should study the
[instructional resources](../../instructional-resources.md) on the
`ArrayIndexedList` implementation before attempting this activity.

You will need the following source code files to complete this activity.

- [`List.java`](src/List.java)
- [`IndexedList.java`](src/IndexedList.java)
- [`ArrayIndexedList.java`](src/ArrayIndexedList.java)
- [`ArrayIndexedListClient.java`](src/ArrayIndexedListClient.java)

**Note:** This activity utilizes [jGRASP Viewers](https://jgrasp.org/tutorials187/10_Viewers.pdf), which are available in [jGRASP](https://jgrasp.org/), [IntelliJ](https://jgrasp.org/ij_plugin.html), and [Eclipse](https://jgrasp.org/eclipse_plugin.html).


## The `shiftRight` method

1. Open `ArrayIndexedListClient.java` in jGRASP, then compile and run it. 

1. Set breakpoints, and then use the debugger and jGRASP viewers to sure you understand what the `main` method is doing.

1. Implement the `shiftRight` method in the `ArrayIndexedList` class. Use the debugger and jGRASP viewers to help you make sure you implement this method correctly. Do not modify any other method.


## Submission

The submission page for this activity asks you to complete the
`ArrayIndexedList.shiftRight` method above and then submit it for a grade.
