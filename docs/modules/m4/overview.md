# Lists, Stacks, and Queues

This module presents **lists**, **stacks**, and **queues** - collections that
are designed to keep elements in some prescribed order. As you can imagine,
keeping things in order is often a fundamental requirement in many different
contexts and applications, so these collections are widely used. What you will
quickly realize is that exactly what "order" means could vary widely, and so
there are different types of lists to match these different kinds of
orderings. In fact, stacks and queues can be viewed as special types of lists
in which order is based on time. To accommodate these natural variations among
otherwise very similar collections, we can adapt the design of our collections
to use interface hierarchies with multiple implementing classes.
