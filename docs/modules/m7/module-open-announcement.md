# Module 7 Announcements

The final module of the course examines the **disjoint set** data structure,
also known as **union-find trees**. This data structure offers an efficient way
to manage sets that have been partitioned into non-overlapping subsets. These
**disjoint sets** have applications in many important problems but, perhaps most
familiarly, in the construction of minimum spanning trees.

Module 7 also has one last programming assignment and, of course, the Final Exam
and Lab Test 3.

Have fun and enjoy!
