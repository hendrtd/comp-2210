# Hands-On: Disjoint Sets

This activity focuses on the fundamental mechanics of working with disjoint sets.


## Representing disjoint sets

1. Open the lecture notes on Disjoint Sets.

1. Review the note set to refresh your memory on this data structure.


## Adding values

1. Go to the slides that illustrate building a disjoint set data structure using the "fast find" strategy.

1. Go through each operation in the slides and make sure you understand how each works.

1. Go to the slides that illustrate building a disjoint set data structure using the "fast union" strategy that utilizes path compression.

1. Go through each operation in the slides and make sure you understand how each works.


## Submission

The submission page for this activity asks you to apply your understanding of
disjoint sets to a problem and then submit it for a grade.
