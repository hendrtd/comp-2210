# Succeeding in This Module

This module introduces **disjoint sets**. As always, this module builds on all the content from the previous modules. Succeeding in this module will require good time management and a commitment to applying the concepts that you are learning. You are encouraged to do the hands-on activities as you watch the lecture videos. These activities are designed to give you practice with ideas being discussed in the videos and with skills required for the assignment. You are also encouraged to begin the assignment as soon as possible. Give yourself plenty of time to complete the assignment in stages rather than waiting until just before it is due.

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts and gets progressively more difficult. It is important to be proactive and to begin your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you don't understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for help sooner rather than later. Asking questions, engaging with the class, and being proactive are good strategies for success.
