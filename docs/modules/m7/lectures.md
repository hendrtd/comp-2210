# Disjoint Sets

In this module we discuss a data structure that is designed to efficiently manage a collection of **disjoint sets**. A disjoint set is a collection of elements that has been partitioned into non-overlapping (disjoint) subsets. Disjoint sets have application in important problems such as image analysis and, as we can relate to, minimum spanning trees.
