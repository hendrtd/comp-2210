# Reflecting on the Module

This module has introduced **disjoint sets** - a collection with many
applications in which deciding if two elements are in the same set must be a
central and scalable operation. Take time now to review and reflect on this
module and the work you've done. But this, of course, is the last module of the
course, so your reflection should look beyond this course to the next term and
courses you may be taking.

- What did you learn?
- How might this help you in upcoming courses?
- What are you still unsure about, and what questions do you have?
- Is there any work that you left undone? Is there still time to complete it?
- Are you satisfied with the way in which you completed this module, and with
  the way you managed your time?
- How might you improve your workflow and study habits for future courses?

Taking time to [reflect on your
experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice), rather than just
moving on, can be an important part of learning and getting better - not just in
school, but on the job and in life.
