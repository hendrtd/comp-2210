# Disjoint Sets

The final module of the course examines the **disjoint set** data structure, also known as **union-find trees**. This data structure offers an efficient way to manage sets that have been partitioned into non-overlapping subsets. These **disjoint sets** have applications in many important problems but, perhaps most familiarly, in the construction of minimum spanning trees.
