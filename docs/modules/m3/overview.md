# Collections, Bags, Array-based and Node-based Implementations

In this module, you will learn about **collections** - generalized containers
for storing and accessing data in a controlled way. You will also learn how to
use specific **data structures** (*arrays* - based on fixed-size memory
allocation - and chains of *linked nodes* - based on dynamically-sized memory
allocation) to build a sample collection. The experience of building a
collection from first principles will be an important one as you continue to
grow as a software developer.
