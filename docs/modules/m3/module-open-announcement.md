# Module 3 Announcements

You have completed two full content modules, and we are now entering the heart
of the course. If you have any questions or concerns about the course or your
progress in it, please don't hesitate to reach out to the instructional staff.

As you begin Module 3, here are a few things to keep in mind.

- Time management, as always, will be important. Be sure to set aside time each
  day to work on this course, and don’t try to get everything done in the one or
  two days before things are due.

- Although the module is laid out sequentially, it might be best to work through
  everything iteratively instead. I suggest starting with the lectures and
  lecture notes, and switching to a hands-on activities once that particular
  topic is covered in the notes. Likewise, once the material needed to complete
  the assignment has been covered in the lectures and you’ve completed the
  associated hands-on activities, start on the assignment. See the resource from
  Module 0 for a discussion of the suggested course workflow.

- An [active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning),
  [self-regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulated_learning)
  approach to learning in this course is crucial to your success. The passive
  activities we typically associate with "studying" (attendance, reading,
  listening, watching) are necessary, but they are not sufficient. For example:
  Don't just read the notes, **do** the notes - actually implement in code the
  algorithms and partial code being presented. 

- The assignment in this module is quite different than the first two, and I
  encourage you to start right away.

- As in each module, the assignment and all hands-on activities are due no later
  than 11:59 PM CT on the last day of the module.

- Be sure to ask any questions that you have. The most efficient way to get
  general questions answered is by posting to the course discussion forum. Don’t
  hesitate to reach out if you need any help or have any questions.

Good luck, and have fun!
