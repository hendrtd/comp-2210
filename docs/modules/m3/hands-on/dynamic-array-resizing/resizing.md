# Hands-On: Dynamic Array Resizing

This activity is designed to reinforce your understanding of the dynamic array
resizing strategy used to implement the `ArrayBag` class. You should study the
[instructional resources](../../instructional-resources.md)
on the `ArrayBag` implementation before attempting this activity.


You will need the following source code files to complete this activity.

- [`Bag.java`](src/Bag.java)
- [`ArrayBag.java`](src/ArrayBag.java)
- [`ArrayIterator.java`](src/ArrayIterator.java)
- [`ArrayBagClient.java`](src/ArrayBagClient.java)

**Note:** This activity utilizes [jGRASP Viewers](https://jgrasp.org/tutorials187/10_Viewers.pdf), which are available in [jGRASP](https://jgrasp.org/), [IntelliJ](https://jgrasp.org/ij_plugin.html), and [Eclipse](https://jgrasp.org/eclipse_plugin.html).


## Dynamic Resizing

1. Open `ArrayBagClient.java`, then compile and run it. Observe the output to understand what the `main` method is doing.

1. Use breakpoints, the debugger, and jGRASP viewers to observe the array being resized as elements are added to the `ArrayBag` object.

1. Modify the `ArrayBagClient` so that elements are both added and removed from the `ArrayBag` object. Then, use breakpoints, the debugger, and jGRASP viewers to observe the array being resized.

1. Continue to experiment with the `ArrayBagClient` until you are confident that you understand the array resizing behavior.


## Submission

The submission page for this activity asks you to apply your understanding of
dynamic array resizing to a problem and then submit it for a grade.
