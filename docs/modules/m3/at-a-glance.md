# Succeeding in This Module

This module introduces **collections** and two specific implementation
patterns for building collections. Succeeding in this module will require good
time management and a commitment to applying the concepts that you are
learning. You are encouraged to do the Hands-On Activities as you watch the
lecture videos. They are designed to give you practice with ideas being
discussed in the videos and with skills required for the assignment. You are
also encouraged to begin the assignment as soon as possible. Give yourself
plenty of time to complete the assignment in stages rather than waiting until
just before it is due.

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts and gets
progressively more difficult. It is important to be proactive and to begin
your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you don't
understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for
help sooner rather than later. Ask questions on Piazza. Engaging with the
class and being proactive are good strategies for success.
