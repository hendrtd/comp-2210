# Instructional Mode

The instructional mode for this course is *Online Synchronous*. The course
will be conducted online in its entirety, and you will not have to be on
campus for any part of this course. There will be optional synchronous online
course activities in which you are expected to participate remotely during the
scheduled class time. The following are the synchronous activities of this
course:

- *Lecture meetings*: Each Tuesday and Thursday I will hold a live Zoom session during the scheduled lecture time (8:00 AM CT - 9:15 AM CT). This live session is optional but encouraged.

- *Lab meetings*: Each Tuesday and Thursday your TA will hold a live Zoom session during your scheduled lab time (varies by section). This live session is optional but encouraged.

- *Exams and Tests*: Exams and Programming Tests will be given during scheduled lab times.

- *Office Hours*: Instructor office hours will be held via Zoom at a set time each week. The specific day/time will be announced on the first day of classes.

You are expected to have all the equipment and software needed to be
successful in this course. At a minimum, you must have what is described in
the *Instructional Technology for Students* section of the [Academic Re-Entry
Plan](https://ahealthieru.auburn.edu/). You must have a computer and a
broadband Internet connection capable of installing and reliably running both
[Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-requirements-for-Windows-macOS-and-Linux)
and [Honorlock](https://honorlock.com/support/). If you have needs regarding
instructional technology, you should contact the AU Bookstore at
`books@auburn.edu`.

Times for all course events (assignment deadlines, exam times, etc.) will be set in US [Central Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ct), which may not correspond to the time zone in which you will be living and studying this fall. You are responsible for meeting deadlines in Central Time regardless of what your local time zone may be. You may find it helpful to follow the instructions linked [here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-set-a-time-zone-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/414) to have Canvas show deadlines appropriately in your local time zone to avoid any confusion.

# Course Description

## Course Notes

Notes and other materials relating to each topic covered in the course are
available through Canvas. You are expected to read the notes and interact with
the other materials as we progress through the course. Although the course
notes are relatively complete, they are not designed to be your only source of
information on the course material. You are expected to use a textbook to
supplement the course notes.


## Vocareum

Vocareum is a cloud-based lab environment in which you will submit programming
assignments and complete programming tests. **Use of Vocareum for the semester
costs $20.**  During the first week of the course, you will be directed to
access Vocareum through Canvas and instructions on making this payment will be
provided.


## Honorlock

This course uses the Honorlock proctoring system for exams and tests. All fees
associated with using Honorlock are being paid by Auburn University this term,
so there is no software to purchase or licensing fee for you to pay.

You must have a computer and a broadband Internet connection capable of
installing and reliably running [Honorlock](https://honorlock.com/support/).


## Zoom

This course uses the Zoom teleconferencing software to facilitate synchronous
interaction during lecture and lab times, office hours, and help sessions.
Zoom is licensed by Auburn University, and you can sign up free of charge for this
added-feature version authenticated with your AU credentials at

# Grading

Your grade for the course will be determined by the points you earn on items
in the following categories.

- **Exams** (40%): There will be three exams in the course, including the final exam. Dates for the first two exams will be set and announced at least one week in advance. All three exams will be administered online using the Honorlock proctoring system.

- **Lab Tests** (25%): There will be three programming-based tests in the course. Dates for each will be set and announced at least one week in advance. All three tests will be administered online using the Honorlock proctoring system. Lab Test grades will be based on the percentage of test cases passed on Vocareum. Passing zero test cases will result in a grade of zero points.

- **Assignments** (30%): There will be seven assignments designed to both reinforce and expand on the topics covered in lecture. Each assignment will specify a well-defined problem with multiple possible solutions. You will be required to apply what you have learned, discover new information, and exercise creative problem solving to construct a solution that meets the problem specification. All assignments require you to express solutions in Java.  Most assignments will be completed individually while some may be completed in teams. Unless it is explicitly stated otherwise, all assignments are to be completed individually and must reflect your own individual work. Assignment grades will be based on the percentage of test cases passed on Vocareum. Passing zero test cases will result in a grade of zero points.

- **Hands-On Activities** (5%): There will be a set of hands-on activities designed to both reinforce and expand on the topics covered in lecture.

Your total score (*Total*) for the course will be calculated as follows, where
*E* is the percentage of possible points earned on exams, *A* is the
percentage of possible points earned on assignments, *T* is the percentage of
possible points earned on lab tests, and *H* is the percentage of possible points
earned on hands-on activities. Each percentage is calculated as (*points earned* / *points possible*) * 100.


*Total* = (0.4 * *E*) + (0.25 * *T*) + (0.3 * *A*) + (0.05 * *H*)

Your letter grade for the course will be assigned based on your *Total*
numeric score using the following scale.

*Total*   | Letter Grade
--------  | ------------
[90, 100] | A
[80, 90)  | B
[70, 80)  | C
[60, 70)  | D
[0, 60)   | F

**Extra Credit:** Opportunities for extra credit are sometimes given to the
entire class, but are never given on an individual basis.

# Course Policies


## Attendance

Attendance per se will not be recorded in this course. Synchronous lecture and
lab sessions are optional but encouraged. 

Since this course is being conducted in Online Synchronous mode, "engagement"
better captures what is expected rather than "attendance." You are expected to
fully engage in this course and take responsibility for your learning
experience. Lack of engagement almost always leads to poor course performance.

If illness or an emergency situation prevents you from being able to
participate in the course, please contact me in advance of affected deadlines
if possible. See  other syllabus policies regarding extended absences, late
submissions, and make-ups.


## Time Commitment

Auburn University has the following
[expectation](http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/student_policies/) of the
time commitment and  work that a course will require per credit hour. "*Auburn
University expects that for each credit hour awarded, an appropriately
prepared student will complete an average of 3-3.5 hours of academic work per
week over the length of a 15 week semester.*" This time estimate is
independent of instructional mode, so although this course is being offered
Online Synchronous, you should plan on spending the same amount of
preparation, work, and “in class” time on this course as you would if you
were taking the course face-to-face. 

This course carries four credit hours, so at a minimum, an "appropriately
prepared" student (read: you did great in COMP 1210) would be expected to
spend 12 hours each week working on this course. Regardless of the specifics,
you are expected to allocate an appropriate amount of time for this course. 

## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is critical to the entire educational process and is a
serious matter in this course. You are expected to apply the 
[Auburn University Oath of Honor](https://wp.auburn.edu/sga/initatives/academic-affairs/oath-of-honor/)
to each graded item in this course:

> In accordance with those virtues of Honesty and Truthfulness set forth in the
> Auburn Creed, I, as a student and fellow member of the Auburn family, do
> hereby pledge that all work is my own, achieved through personal merit and
> without any unauthorized aid. In the promotion of integrity, and for the
> betterment of Auburn, I give honor to this, my oath and obligation.

Issues surrounding violations of academic honesty will be handled per the 
[Student Academic Honesty Code](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/policies/academichonestycode.pdf). 
You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with this policy and the other 
resources available from the 
[Office of Academic Effectiveness](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/academic-effectiveness/academic-honesty.php).

What constitutes cheating on exams and tests is fairly obvious, and everyone
understands that anything other than individual work on these is wrong. Where
many students are unsure of what is allowable and what is not allowable is in
the completion of programming assignments. I encourage students to form study
groups, help each other learn the course material, and help each other solve
problems. Collaborative problem solving is a great way to learn. However,
collaborative problem solving must be restricted to the level of concepts,
strategies, and algorithms; it should never involve source code. If you're in
doubt about a certain practice, it's best to ask rather than assume it's okay.
In certain instances, course work is to be completed in groups rather than
individually, but these instances will be clearly identified by the instructor
and the collaboration is allowed only within the bounds set by the instructor.


## Communication with Instructor and Teaching Assistants

Your Auburn University email address (`@auburn.edu`) is the university-approved form of communication between instructors and students. Email is preferred to the Canvas messaging feature. Emails that you send to the instructor or to a teaching assistant should come from your `@auburn.edu` email address. Sending emails from addresses other than `@auburn.edu` could result in you not receiving a response to your message.

All course announcements will be posted to Canvas and/or sent to your
`@auburn.edu` address. All email communications from the instructor to you
will be sent to your `@auburn.edu` address. Follow the steps in the video
linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Notification-Preferences-All-Users/ta-p/383690)
to set your notifications preferences and specify that all course alerts are
routed to your `@auburn.edu` email address. You are expected to check both
Canvas and your `@auburn.edu` account daily. 

## Getting Help in the Course

If you find yourself struggling academically in this course, please reach out to your instructor and/or a teaching assistant as soon as possible. Do not wait until the end of the semester to seek help for problems that were present weeks earlier. The instructor and teaching assistants want to help you, but can not do so unless you ask in a timely manner.

## Accessibility

Students who need accommodations are asked to electronically submit their
approved accommodations through AU Access and to arrange a meeting with me
during the first week of classes, or as soon as possible if accommodations are
immediately needed. If you need accommodations but have not established them,
make an appointment with the Office of Accessibility, 1228 Haley Center,
334-844-2096.

## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in
and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be
viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, religion,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, veteran status, ethnicity,
race, and culture. All students in this course are expected to respect their
fellow classmates and actively participate in fostering an inclusive learning
environment. If you experience anything in this class that makes you feel
uncomfortable, please bring it to my attention and we will formulate a
response. If you would prefer to remain anonymous you may complete a 
[Bias Incident Report](http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/bert/submit-a-report-of-bias/) 
which will maintain your confidentiality.

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other
students or student groups.

## Classroom Behavior

The Auburn University 
[Policy on Classroom Behavior](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassroomBehavior.pdf)
is strictly followed in this course. Note that this policy extends to all
virtual elements of this course including Zoom, Honorlock, Vocareum, Piazza,
and all electronic communication.

## Late Assignment Submission

All assignments are due at 11:59 PM CT on the date specified in Canvas. No
late submissions will be accepted except for approved University excuses.

## Exam and Test Makeup

Students who miss an exam or test must contact the instructor and turn in a
valid excuse **within 48 hours** from the time that the exam or test was
given. Valid excuses include illness documented by a physician, evidence of
personal or family emergency, and official university excuses. If you do not
contact the instructor with a valid excuse within 48 hours of the missed exam
or test, the exam or test score will be zero.

The makeup schedule is determined by the instructor and will need to be done
within five business days from the time that the exam or test was given. The
format, questions, and difficulty level of makeups are not guaranteed to be
the same as the normal exam. Students who miss the makeup without a valid
excuse will have zero recorded as the score for the missed exam or test.


## Grade Appeals

Scores for all graded items will be posted to Canvas. You will have five
business days from the date that a score is posted to Canvas to send an email
to the instructor requesting grade adjustments on your work. If no appeal is
sent to the instructor after five business days, the score is final. Once the
five-day appeal period has passed, students forfeit their right to have the
graded material reassessed at a later date.

To appeal a grade that you have received, send an email to the instructor
specifying the graded item in question and justifying in a clear, concise
manner why you think your response should be awarded more points. Once
received, the instructor may or may not communicate with you regarding your
appeal. Ultimately, the instructor will render a decision. 

## Extended Student Absence

If illness causes you to be unable to participate in the course, please
contact me as soon as possible to discuss your options.

## Extended Instructor Absence

If illness causes me to be unable to continue teaching the course, a back-up
instructor has been selected who will assume all teaching responsibilities to
ensure that the course will proceed uninterrupted.

## Auburn University Transition to Remote Operations

Since this course is being delivered in Online Synchronous mode, neither
course requirements nor course delivery will change in the event that the
University is forced to move to remote operations and fully online
instruction. However, you should personally plan now for this contingency to
ensure that you will be able to minimize the disruption this move could cause
to your personal living and study arrangements.

## Data Collection and Use Disclosure

Any and all results of graded items in the course are data sources for
research and assessment, and may be used in publications related to research
and accreditation. All such use will be anonymous.
